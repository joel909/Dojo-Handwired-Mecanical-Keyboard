<p>DOJO -- It‚Äôs entirely custom-designed, from the case to the plate and even the layout. So, what exactly is a mechanical keyboard, and how is it different from a normal one?

A mechanical keyboard uses individual mechanical switches for each key. When the kays are pressed there is distinct tactile feedback and often an audible click, which makes typing feel more precise and satisfying. On the other hand, normal keyboards, often referred to as membrane keyboards, use a rubber dome under each key. This can make the keys feel mushy and less responsive. Also custom building mechanical keyboards will enable you to make any modification like the layout changes like changing keys adding custom keys for custom response .AT THE END OF THE DAY MECANICAL KEYBOARDS ARE INSANLY COOL NO MATTER WHAT

mechanical keyboards are generally more durable and customizable. you choose different types of switches based on your typing preferences. However, they do tend to be louder and more expensive compared to membrane keyboards and for more expensive if ur building one but i must agree to it that it is a very fun and cool journey to go through.

<strong>How did I make this project?? ‚Äì </strong> This is a relatively easy part to explain  the technical stuff SOOO starting off I had created a plan In my mind after watching tons of yt videos on custom mechanical keyboard . I wanted the intersection of all the custom builds I had seen(definitely dint use ‚Äúintersection‚Äù to flex my bad math skill ) I had decided I need a perfect detachable mechanical keyboard with type-c port also I wanted it be really super thin(seems too simple of requirements but it isn‚Äôt ).Then I created my first ever prototype of the keyboard below are a few images of it it looks sooo dammm raww.
<h3>First Prototype</h3>
<p><strong>My first prototype with an pro micro dint have soldering tools or expertise so i hot glued all the wires so that they stay</strong></p>

<p>Well to be honest building a Custom mechanical keyboard might sound pretty useless and a project which is a huge waste of time while it might be true I don‚Äôt agree with it at least not with the waste of time part. I remember explaining this project to a few people who really have no idea about mechanical keyboard none of them ever saw this as a worth it project btw people who do know about mechanical keyboards and custom bult keyboards they really understood what I‚Äôve made. My personal opinion ‚Äì while it might not be a cool project in your portfolio or whatever if your doing projects for the sake of a portfolio yes, this project is a huge waste of time but if your doing this to learn new things this is a great project. I personally have learned soo many things from this single project I have never done a project which taught me more. To actually completely make one you‚Äôll need to do stuff from 3D-printing/designing to electronics to soldering. When I started out my journey of building a custom mechanical keyboard, I had no clue about all this all I knew was that I had to make one at any cost (it turned out to be costly). Well to start off I never knew 3D modelling/Designing I never knew soldering or how to even solder 2 part together if this was not enough, I dint even know how microcontrollers work or operate, obviously I had done stuff on Arduino btw that‚Äôs nowhere near the actual stuff your supposed to deal with. all this cuz I was a pure software guy I had barely done stuff on hardware. And at the end of this long journey I learning soldering and became decent and I learnt enough 3d-modeling (fusion 360) to be able to make my own prints for my other projects as well. I also learned a lot about microcontrollers started with an Arduino pro-micro and then learned about that which was pretty basic and dint catch my interest btw when I started with stm32 series it actually caught my interest and I was fascinated by the world of electronics and what all I could do with it. It was insane and I learnt about how all these chips are actually used in our daily use stuff like an STM could be inside my remote how cool right. Through this journey I also learned about PCB design even tho I never tried making one cuz its costly getting it printed. Its hard in words to explain how much ive learned while making this custom keyboard</p>
